# CS4930-project
Terms of Service (TOS) and privacy policy reviewer

## Problem Statement 
Privacy policies are long and difficult to understand, and cause frustrations in the daily lives of most people. Our project is to create a relatively simple and intuitive program to review these documents and provide the user with the information in a format and language that are easier to read and comprehend, so that they can make informed decisions about what they are agreeing to.

## Solution
Our proposed solution is a website that processes privacy policies and provides users with a more approachable summary to read. Users can input a document, paste text, or simply give the URL of a privacy policy and the website will output a natural language summary along with definitions or explanations of confusing terms.

## Tools
### Languages
- Python: Backend, API calls, etc.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: frontend UX/UI
### Frameworks and Libraries
- Bootstrap
- Scrapy
